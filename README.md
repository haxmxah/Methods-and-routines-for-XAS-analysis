Simple python code to treat XAS data from image J

#Content
Here we present the different methods and routines that have been developed for the chemical analysis and XLMD of XAS spectra, focused on the type of files returned by Image J. It has to be refactored to be universal to all types of files (work in progress).

You will find variables that are not useful for you because of how the files were created and how the data was organized as they were acquired during the analysis and research process. So code must adapt to eachother way of working.

It is posted as an illustrative example to give ideas.

Here we:

- Generate XLMD graphs and data by difference and quotient.
- Generate XAS spectra and data.
- Generate graphs and data for comparing spectra.
- Generate XLMD for different angles with a least square fit of a function.
- Generate normalization data and graphs.
